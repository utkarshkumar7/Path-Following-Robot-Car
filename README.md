# Path-Following-Robot-Car
I used a TI Robotics Systems Learning Kit and utilized Energia to assemble a robotic car and code the PID controls to allow it to follow a path.
The microcontroller used was a TI-MSP432 and phototransistors on the car detected raw data which was calibrated and processed by the MCU. 
The report document contains a step-by-step description of how I assembled the car, calibrated the sensors, performed sensor fusion using Excel, and then finally developed the firmware for the car to complete a race track in around 8 seconds.

The diagram below shows how the system of this robotic car worked:
